knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

pkgs <- c("psych",
          "tidyr",
          "tidyverse",
          "dplyr",

library(gapminder)
```

## Examine Data
```{r}
# extract variable names
colnames(gapminder)
```

```{r}
skim(gapminder)
```

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)
```

## Variable Class

### Before you run any analyses, you'll need to make sure the variable class is correct (e.g. factor vs numeric vs character). 


  **Variable Classes**
    
    1. Integers are whole numbers without decimal points.
    
    2. Numeric/double is a general class that includes both 
      decimals (floating-point numbers) and integers. 
    
    3. Factor represents categorical data. 
      They can store both string and integer values.
    
    4. Character represents a string in R. 
    
    5. Logical represents boolean values, with 
      TRUE, FALSE, and NA as possible values.


```{r}
# View class of each variable
lapply(gapminder, class)

# Factor = Nominal in SPSS
```

## Intro to Dplyr
### Select, Filter, Mutate, Arrange, Transmute

#### Select allows us to easily subset our data by only selecting the desired variables.
```{r}
# new_df <-
gapminder %>%
  select (country, lifeExp)
```

#### Filter, just like the filter function in SPSS, allows us to work with the cases that meet certain criteria

```{r}
# filtered_df <- # Saves in global environment
gapminder %>%
  filter(continent == "Africa", year > 1990) %>%
  head()

```

  **SPSS Syntax: Filtering**
  
    DATASET COPY  filtered_df.
    DATASET ACTIVATE  filtered_df.
    FILTER OFF.
    USE ALL.
    SELECT IF ((continent = 'Africa')  & (year > 1990)).
    EXECUTE.

#### Mutate creates new variables or changes existing variables (if you do not provide a new name). The SPSS equivalent is COMPUTE VARIABLE.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(log.gdp = log(gdpPercap)) %>%
  head()
```

   **SPSS Syntax: Compute variable**
    
    COMPUTE diff.gdp=gdpPercap - mean(gdpPercap).
    EXECUTE.
    
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(diff.gdp = gdpPercap - mean(gdpPercap, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  head()
```

#### Transmute is a mix between select and mutate

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  transmute (country, population_divided = pop/2)
```

#### Summarize (or summarise) calculates a single value per group. Useful for aggregating data.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(desc(year))
```

  **Other functions you may want to use with mutate and summarize:**

    1. sum (x, na.rm = TRUE)
    2. max (x, na.rm = TRUE)
    3. min (x, na.rm = TRUE)
    4. n_distinct (x) <- count number of unique instances

# Dplyr cheatsheet 
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '140%'}

knitr::include_graphics('data-transformation.png')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '140%'}

knitr::include_graphics('data-transformation2.png')
```

### Challenge!

1. Create a dataframe that contains the average life expectancy for each continent.

2. Generate a dataframe that shows the total population per year for each country in Europe.

3. Create a dataframe that only includes Asian countries with a life expectancy greater than 70 years in the year 2007. This subset should ONLY include these variables: continent, year, and lifeExp.

--------------

## Using a real dataset

Here, we're using some a real dataset with responses from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). This is a common measure for trait empathy. Now, before we **could** analyze it, we need to make some changes to the data. 

1. Variables *ID, Dyad, Condition* need to be treated like *factors*
2. We need to delete one variable (iri1)
3. Some participants should be excluded, so we want to remove those cases
4. Some items on the IRI need to be reverse-scored
5. Create a composite score, representing each participant's trait empathy. **Based on the IRI documentation, this should be a *sum* not a *mean* (varies by measure)**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
emp_df <- read_csv("/Users/kareenadelrosario/Desktop/Local R Code/Empathy_Background_randomized.csv")
```

### Examine Data
```{r}
colnames(emp_df)
```

### Change Variable Class
```{r}
#### Option 1
# Change ID, Dyad, and Condition to factor
emp_df$ID <- as.factor(emp_df$ID)
class(emp_df$ID)

#### Option 2
## Useful when converting multiple variables. Note: [,X] = by column
# Convert categorical variables to factor
names <- c(1:2, 31)
emp_df[,names] <- lapply(emp_df[,names], factor)
head(lapply(emp_df, class))

#### Option 3
## Use dplyr to change class and apply value labels
# Label gender and condition and make sure they're classified as factors
emp_df <- 
  emp_df %>%
  mutate(ID = factor(ID),
         Dyad = factor(Dyad),
         Condition = factor(Condition, labels = c("Sad", "Control"))) # Change from 0,1 to Control and Sad

#### Option 4
## Use dplyr to change class and apply value labels with across()
emp_df <- 
    emp_df %>%
    mutate(across(c(ID, Dyad, Condition), as.factor))  

emp_df <- 
    emp_df %>% 
    mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))


emp_df %>% 
  select(ID, Dyad, Condition) %>%
  head()
```

### Remove Variables (Columns) and Cases (Rows)
#### Variables
```{r}
# Delete variables
emp_df %>%
  select(-c(iri1)) %>%
  head()
```
#### Cases
```{r}
# Exclude participants by dyad ID
emp_df <- emp_df[ !(emp_df$Dyad %in% c(121, 124, 158, 168, 153)), ]

# Or by row number
emp_df %>%
  slice(-c(58:59, 117:118, 137:138, 107:108))
```

### Composite Scores
```{r}
#### Option 1
reverse <- emp_df %>%
  mutate(iri3r = 6 - iri3,
         iri4r = 6 - iri4,
         iri7r = 6 - iri7,
         iri12r = 6 - iri12,
         iri13r = 6 - iri13,
         iri14r = 6 - iri14,
         iri15r = 6 - iri15,
         iri18r = 6 - iri18,
         iri19r = 6 - iri19)

#### Option 2
# rowwise tells r to go by ROW not column
# we can also reverse code in one step! (Add -6 before item)
emp_df <- emp_df %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(emp_sum = sum(c(iri1, iri2, 6-iri3, 6-iri4, iri5, iri6, 6-iri7, iri8, iri9, iri10,iri11,6-iri12,6-iri13,6-iri14,6-iri15,iri16,iri17,6-iri18,6-iri19,iri20,iri21,iri22,iri23,iri24,iri25,iri26,iri27,iri28)))
```

Amazing! Now let's move onto something a bit harder. Let's talk about conditional mutates and restructuring the dataframe.

### Conditional mutate (ifelse)

Using the same dataset, we want to add a few new ID and condition variables. After completing the IRI, participants were paired in dyads, half of which were in the *sad dyads* while the other half were in the *control dyads*. 

Within the *sad dyad*, 1 person was in the *sad condition* (told a sad story) and their partner was in the *control condition* (told a neutral story). 

Both participants in the *control dyads* told a neutral story.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics('sad_cond.png')
```

Right now, we just have the ID, Dyad, and Dyad-level Condition variables, but we want to create new variables that reflect this complexity (e.g., differentiate between the participants in the *sad dyad*: were they the *sad actor* or *control partner*?)

The ID variable is the same thing as the Dyad variable except it has a 1 (Actor) and 2 (Partner) at the end. For example, *Dyad 200* has *participant 2001 (Actor)* and *participant 2002 (Partner)*.

1. Identify the actor vs partner in each dyad by creating a partner variable
2. 

#### In SPSS: COMPUTE VARIABLE (IF)
```{r}
# This dataset does not have a "partner" variable, which is super important for dyadic data. 

# we'll need to make ID and Dyad numeric to calculate partner
emp_df %>% 
  transmute(ID.n = as.numeric(ID)) #issue with converting factor to numeric

## Use mutate to create a "partner" variable.
emp_df <- emp_df %>%
  mutate(ID.n = as.numeric(as.character(ID)),
         Dyad.n = as.numeric(as.character(Dyad)),
         partner = ID.n - (Dyad.n * 10)) %>%
  mutate(partner = factor(partner))

# Preview variables
emp_df %>%
  select(Dyad, ID, partner)
```

```{r}
## If we wanted to recode an existing variable, we could use this function: 
emp_df$Condition[emp_df$Condition == 1] <- 'Sad'

## We'll need to create a new condition variable to distinguish each individual condition (sad actors vs sad partners vs control dyad)
emp_df_recode <- emp_df %>%
  mutate(p_cond = ifelse( (Condition == "Sad") & (partner == 1), 2,
                          ifelse( (Condition == "Sad") & (partner == 2), 1, 3))) %>%
  mutate(p_cond = factor(p_cond))

#### Sad Partner = 1
#### Sad Actor = 2
#### Control Dyad = 3

## Double-check new variable
emp_df_recode %>%
  select(ID, Condition, partner, p_cond)
```

```{r}
# Remove missing values from emp_df
emp_df_recode <- emp_df_recode %>%
  drop_na(emp_sum, Condition) %>%
  group_by (Dyad) %>%
  filter(n() == 2) %>%
  ungroup()
```

# Restructuring Dataset

### Wide vs Long Format
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('wide_ex.png')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics('long_ex.png')
```

## Wide to Long
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create the dataframe
df_wide <- data.frame(
  ID = c(9991, 9992, 9993, 9994),
  '1990' = c(3, 2, 1, 4),
  '1992' = c(4, 5, 5, 2),
  '1994' = c(2, 3, 5, 3),
  '1996' = c(4, 4, 2, 5),
  check.names = FALSE # R doesn't love numerical column names. this tells it to chill out.
)

print(df_wide)
```


### Pivot_longer() from tidyr

Now, we want to change this so that it's in long format. There should be multiple entries for each ID and Year should be a single variable.
```{r}
#### Option 1
df_long <- pivot_longer(df_wide,
                        cols = !ID, # variables that should be left alone
                        names_to = "Year", # header of wide_df
                        values_to = "Value") # values that correspond to variable names
head(df_long)


#### Option 2
df_wide %>%
 pivot_longer(
   cols = starts_with("199"), # could specify which columns to pivot
   names_to = "Year",
   values_to = "Value",
   values_drop_na = TRUE # exclude NAs
 )
```

## Long to wide
### Pivot_wider()

Let's reverse it and spread out the Year.
```{r}
df_wide2 <- pivot_wider(df_long,
                        names_from = Year,
                        values_from = Value,
                        values_fill = 999) # fill NA with 999

head(df_wide2)
```

```{r}
### Is it identical to our other wide df?
setequal(df_wide, df_wide2)
```

# Quick guide to correlations in R

To compute basic correlation coefficients there are three main functions that can be used: *cor(), cor.test() and rcorr()*. functions. The functions *cor()* and *cor.test()* are part of the base system in R, but *rcorr()* is part of the Hmisc package. The output varies between the three: if you want a confidence interval then you will have to use *cor.test()*, and if you want correlation coefficients for multiple pairs of variables then you cannot use *cor.test()*; similarly, if you want p-values then *cor()* won’t help you, etc.

## cor()

Here, we’re looking at the correlation between iri at Time 1 and Time 2. cor() only outputs correlation.

```{r}
# Note that cor does not like NAs. Check doc using ?cor for NA options
# pearson correlation is default
cor(emp_df_recode$iri2, emp_df_recode$iri3, use = "complete.obs")

# rank correlation coefficient
cor(emp_df_recode$iri2, emp_df_recode$iri3, use = "complete.obs", method = "spearman")
```

We could also run correlation matrix using the following:
```{r}
cor(emp_df_recode[,c("iri2", "iri3", "iri4")], use = "complete.obs")
```

#### How would you interpret this matrix?

## cor.test()

cor.test is a correlation test between paired samples. It outputs the correlation plus the 95% CI, t-stat, df, and p-value.

```{r}
cor.test(emp_df_recode$iri2, emp_df_recode$iri3)
```

## rcorr()
load library(Hmisc). rcorr outputs correlation matrix, n, and p values.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(Hmisc)

# convert df into a matrix
matrix1 <- as.matrix(emp_df_recode[,c("iri2", "iri3", "iri4")])

# correlation matrix
rcorr(matrix1)
```

----------

## BONUS: Introduction to Writing Functions

To introduce you to what goes into writing a function, let's create a function that computes a mean.
```{r}
var_mean <- function(variable) # what does the function require to be input
{
  mean <- sum(variable)/length(variable) # how is a mean calculated
  cat("Mean = ", mean) # what it should print
}

# Let's test it out!

# Create data
test_data <- c(5,12,98,23,45,7,86,34)

# Now let's try it out
var_mean(test_data)
```

## Using Functions for Things We Normally Can't Do in R

### Option 1: create your own function 

```{r}
descriptive_table <- function(x) { # our function accepts just a variable. if in a df, it'll be df$variable
  tab_mean <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) # compute mean
  tab_sd <- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE) # compute sd
  tab_min <- min(x, na.rm = TRUE) # find minimum value
  tab_max <- max(x, na.rm = TRUE) # find maximum value
	cat("Summary of descriptive statistics\n") # print title
	cat("Mean:               ", tab_mean, "\n") # print mean... and so on.
	cat("Standard Deviation: ", tab_sd, "\n")
	cat("Minimum:            ", tab_min,    "\n")
	cat("Maximum:            ", tab_max,    "\n")
  
}


descriptive_table(emp_df_recode$iri12)
```

### Option 2: shorten existing functions with partial() from the purrr package
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(purrr)

# adding shortcuts
mymean <- partial(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```
